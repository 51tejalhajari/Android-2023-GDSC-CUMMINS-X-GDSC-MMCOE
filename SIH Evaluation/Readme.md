# SIH Evaluation

â†’ A description of what this project will be about:

* We want to develop an android application which will evaluate the marks for the project ideas presented by students for SIH 2023. 
* The evaluation will be done on the basis of some metrics which will be in the form of questions. The marking can be done manualy or automatically. For automatic marking the questions will be in the form of checkboxes and radiobuttons on the basis of question. If the question can have multiple answers then we will use checkbox and if it can have only one answer then we will use radiobuttons. 
* Each question will have a separate page and details about the questoion will be given in the issue. 
* The flow of the app is shown below:
