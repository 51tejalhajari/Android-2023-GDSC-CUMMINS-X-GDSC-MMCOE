# SIH Evaluation

â†’ A description of what this project will be about:

* We want to develop an Android application which will evaluate the marks for the project ideas presented by students for SIH 2023. 
* The evaluation will be done on the basis of some metrics which will be in the form of questions. The marking can be done manually or automatically. For automatic marking, the questions will be in the form of radio buttons on the basis of the question. 
* Each question will have a separate page and details about the questions will be given in the issue. 
* The flow of the app is shown below:

**1.** Here the first page will be the login page. The contributor needs to create a login page for authentication and authorization. 

**2.** After the login page a page should be displayed for the option of whether the judge is external or internal. 

**3.** After the selection of one of the buttons with the external or internal judge, the next page should hold two buttons with marking manually or marking automatically. 

**4.** Further after choosing the option if the selection is:

**i)** Manual marking: The next page will hold a question and the user will give marks of that question out of 10 in an editText.

**ii)** Automatic marking: If the option chosen is automatic then the question will be displayed in the form of MCQ's and the user has to choose option on the basis of the question. Each radio button will hold a value and the marks will be calculated automatically in the end as a result. 

**5.** In the end a result page will display the marks obtained after adding the marks from editText values or values contained by the MCQ's options. 

**6.** Below is the UI of how the application should look like:
